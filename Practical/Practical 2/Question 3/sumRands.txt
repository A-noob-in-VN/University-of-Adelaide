Since in this case, we're using the 'randi()' for calculating, so the output will
be vary. Then in this text, I only write down the expectation after a few times 
testing.
After times running, I found out the code may give me:
- Maximum number: 50
- Minimum number: 5
- And for the average, it should be about 25.
